https://solartesla.nl/

This Python script connects to your Tesla and your HomeWizard P1 meter (https://www.homewizard.com/nl/p1-meter/).
When your solar panels are feeding back to the grid; SolarTesla uses your surplus to charge your Tesla car.<br><br>

#Install
Open the script with your favorite Python editor (like https://thonny.org/).<br>
On the first run it creates an settings file. Edit this to use the email address you're also using for your Tesla account.<br><br>

On the next run SolarTesla will redirect to Chrome to login on your Tesla account.<br>
